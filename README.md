## A playful minimalistic UI.



Iridescent is an open source lightweight CSS styling framework. It's a component library aimed at being user friendly and helping you focus on the how, and why's of design and get right to building.
The entire library was designed keeping in mind that it's easy to use and get started.

Choosy Dev? Don't worry we have plenty of component variants to keep you interested and invested.

Just like the various colors of light you see in a bubble, Iridescent will offer you plenty of choices to play with.

## Usage
In order to introduce Iridescent to your project, Copy the link given below and paste it in the head tag of your html, above all other style sheets.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://iridescent.vercel.app/main.css">
## Alternative
Add the following import to your CSS file at the top before all other CSS file imports.

    @import url("https://iridescent.vercel.app/main.css");
## Directory
Now that you've imported the library to your project, you'll need some help from us to get yourself going. Fret not. We at Iridescent have put together a 
nifty documentation site for you to refer to and even copy the boiler plate code to use our components. 

P.S. Feel free to play around with our components and make them your own, after all, it is designed to be your best friend :D
